From your perspective, a Peregrine Falcon's unchanging stare is almost insulting. But 200 miles is not anything new for him. There is simply no reason for him to frown, to laugh, or care. The only thing he knows is the last thing you will: He goes fast.
		
	~The movements needed to avoid this encounter, which every grunt of the dirt each day approach, need to be whisker-fine and articulated with instinct. The only way is to *not be prey*~
