Cats:

Cats are small, fur-covered animals that many enjoy to have as pets. 
They are innately curious and enjoy knocking objects off countertops. Do not leave a glass of water near any electronics if there is a cat present. 

Cats have excelent night-vision and whiskers that help them sense the world around them.
