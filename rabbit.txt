Rabbits are small creatures that are generally seen as cute.
They are covered with a layer of fluff called fur.
There are many different types of rabbits, like:
Holland Lop, American Fuzzy Lop, European rabbit, Mini Lop, Cottentail rabbit, Cashmere Lop, and more.
They jump a fair amount, typically are known for eating carrots 
Personally, they have a cute little stomp when they are angry.

Insert joke about rabbits in media like from Monty Python or the Irish Fighting game man's rabbits.
PS: Not expecting anyone to know the ladder, its just referenced because why not.
